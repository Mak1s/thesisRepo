## X3ML Evolution Manager (XEM)

X3ML Evolution Manager (XEM) is a user-friendly, interactive web application that facilitates users spotting
and defining the corresponding parts of their X3ML definitions that have
to change, based on a new version of an ontology. XEM provides these features
in an intuitive user interface, that guides users upload their X3ML
mapping file and ontology and then define their conversions using suggestions
to avoid redundancies and also avoid typing errors.
